Results
To achieve these results, the City Bike rideshare data for August 2019 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip was used and retrieved from Citi Bike's System Data web page.

Biking Summary Dashboard:

The image below shows a summary dashboard of the data retrieved from Citi Bike.

The dashboard shows over 2 million people use bikes in one August of 2019 majority of them being male. 

-There are more bikes available in those location
-There are more people living in this particular area
-This area may be filled with tourist spots that would be enjoyed better on the bikes
-The area is very bike friendly i.e. lots of bike lanes


Checkout Time Dashboard:

When looking at the checkout times dashboard, it seems most of the bikes are checked out at the 5 to 6 minute mark of the hour no matter the gender. The graphs also show no matter the gender, the duration of most rides are less than one hour.

Trips per Weekday, Hour, Gender, Usertype:


The final dashboard shows what time of the day and what day of the week the trips occur. This dashboard also shows if the users are single use customers or subscribers. The graph images show that majority of riders are subscribers which show that people who are interested in biking believe that the service is good enough to subscribe to. Slide 2 shows most riders ride for less than 1 hour, if most check-ins are at 6pm, it shows most rides happend between 5 pm and 6pm. Thursdays also seem to be the preffered day of the week for riding.

Summary:


From the story formed by the dashboard, it is safe to say bikesharing has a good potential to be successful in areas where there are:

tourist locations
bike lanes for safe bike riding
large dense population
close by stands for those who need a quick ride
mantainance can be done during odd hours (i.e. ealry morning 2 AM to 5 AM)
